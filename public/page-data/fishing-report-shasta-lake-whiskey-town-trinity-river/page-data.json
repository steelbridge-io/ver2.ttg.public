California. This page is packed with the latest fishing reports from the waters where I provide guided fishing experiences, guided fishing tours. Each fishing report below will take you to an archive of previous reports so you can more clearly understand the fishing and the destination. In each fishing report, my goal is to provide my most recent experiences for that body of water be it a lake or river, a tip or two for anglers heading out on their own, a forecast on how the water should fish and what seasonal impacts to expect. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comeback regularly to read my updates. This report page will be updated with my most recent reports no less than every month.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>To get reports delivered to your email/inbox, subscribe here:</h4>","template":{"templateName":"Default"}}},
