This boat ramp or boat launch is possibly the most important boat ramp logistically on the Lower Sacramento River out of Redding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anderson River Park Boat Ramp is referred to as &#8220;Ando&#8221; by the guides. A popular takeout for anglers floating the Lower Sacramento during the summer months from the Posse Grounds or from Bonnieview during the shorter days and possibly lower river flows of winter, Anderson River Park is mostly used as a take out destination. Easy to float by, 1st-time anglers routinely float past the opening where boats navigate into a side-channel out of the current to access the boat ramp. The opening is bracketed by riparian structure and blackberry bushes. Once past it, you are almost too late as the current will swiftly take you downstream. Some anglers end up anchoring their boat along the bank about 100 yards down river and climb up and into the park where it&#8217;s an easy walk to the car/truck. At least you can rally from there and determine how to get the boat out (often by walking it upstream, then rowing like a sculling champion upstream just to squeak the stern into the boat ramp opening.  Fun!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anderson River Park Boat Ramp is also a great launching spot. Anglers can then access some of the more remote sections of the Lower Sacramento River below the town of Anderson. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popular take outs below &#8220;Ando&#8221; are Balls Ferry and the infamous Barge Hole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding Anderson River Park Boat is a little more detailed than say the Posse Grounds or Bonnieview. With that being said, we recommend using the map provided below in helping you find your way to the ramp from Interstate 5.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Find Anderson River Park Boat Ramp: Map</h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wpgmp_map_container wpgmp-map-5\" rel=\"map5\"><div class=\"wpgmp_map_parent\"><div class=\"wpgmp_map \" style=\"width:100%; height:500px;\" id=\"map5\" ></div></div></div><script>jQuery(document).ready(function($) {var map5 = $(\"#map5\").maps({\"map_options\":{\"center_lat\":\"40.4675973\",\"center_lng\":\"-122.27997\",\"zoom\":14,\"map_type_id\":\"ROADMAP\",\"draggable\":true,\"scroll_wheel\":true,\"display_45_imagery\":\"\",\"marker_default_icon\":\"https:\\/\\/thetrinityguide.com\\/wp-content\\/plugins\\/wp-google-map-plugin\\/assets\\/images\\/\\/default_marker.png\",\"infowindow_setting\":\"\",\"infowindow_bounce_animation\":\"\",\"infowindow_drop_animation\":false,\"close_infowindow_on_map_click\":false,\"default_infowindow_open\":false,\"infowindow_open_event\":\"click\",\"full_screen_control\":true,\"search_control\":true,\"zoom_control\":true,\"map_type_control\":true,\"street_view_control\":true,\"full_screen_control_position\":\"TOP_LEFT\",\"search_control_position\":\"TOP_LEFT\",\"zoom_control_position\":\"TOP_LEFT\",\"map_type_control_position\":\"TOP_LEFT\",\"map_type_control_style\":\"HORIZONTAL_BAR\",\"street_view_control_position\":\"TOP_LEFT\",\"map_control\":true,\"map_control_settings\":false,\"map_zoom_after_search\":6,\"width\":\"\",\"height\":\"500\"},\"places\":[{\"id\":\"4\",\"title\":\"Anderson River Park Boat Ramp\",\"address\":\"3601 Rupert Road, Anderson, CA 96007, USA\",\"source\":\"manual\",\"content\":\"Anderson River Park Boat Ramp\",\"location\":{\"icon\":\"https:\\/\\/thetrinityguide.com\\/wp-content\\/plugins\\/wp-google-map-plugin\\/assets\\/images\\/\\/default_marker.png\",\"lat\":\"40.467202\",\"lng\":\"-122.279554\",\"city\":\"Anderson\",\"state\":\"California\",\"country\":\"United States\",\"onclick_action\":\"marker\",\"redirect_custom_link\":\"\",\"marker_image\":\"\",\"open_new_tab\":\"yes\",\"postal_code\":\"96007\",\"draggable\":false,\"infowindow_default_open\":false,\"animation\":\"BOUNCE\",\"infowindow_disable\":true,\"zoom\":5,\"extra_fields\":\"\"},\"categories\":[],\"custom_filters\":\"\"}],\"styles\":\"\",\"listing\":\"\",\"map_property\":{\"map_id\":\"5\"}}).data(\"wpgmp_maps\");});</script>","template":{"templateName":"Default"}}},
