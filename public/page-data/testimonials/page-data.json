I have had the pleasure of knowing Alex since he was a Boy. Alex&nbsp;cut his teeth on the sportfishing boats in Monterey Bay, climbing the ranks among his peers. He started deckhanding on the Charter boats in middle school. Alex always had a fierce determination and an ability to learn while getting along with the crew and passengers.<br>Over the many years I have had the pleasure of fishing and hunting with Alex many times. Alex has proven his proficiency in his ability to learn the waters he is fishing and adapt to conditions while letting his clients feel safe and at ease.<br>With many years in the sportfishing industry under my belt, I can assure any client that Alex Ross will host you on a successful fishing adventure, with safety and respect.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Captain Mike Baxter.</strong></em><br><em><strong>captmikebaxter@yahoo.com</strong></em><br><em><strong>(831)588-9577</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’ve fished with Alex for years and it is a blast to be on the water with him. He is deadly on the troll if it’s in the lakes or in the ocean! If anybody knows where the fish are and what will get them on the bite it’s him. I work as a fisheries biologist for a Northern California Native American Tribe, and when we are on the river Alex is always picking my brain about the habitat and the fish, but I learn as much from him as he does from me. As a captain, Alex is safe, prepared, and great at communication, but by far his biggest asset is his positive attitude. No matter the conditions, it’s always a good day on the water fishing with Alex! Thanks for he memorable trip the other day, already looking forward to next time!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Kyle De Juilio</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>“Alex is a professional at whatever he does. Fishing and hunting being number one. If there&#8217;s a fish to be caught, Alex will find it! He&#8217;s a pleasure to be around and knows how to make everyone&#8217;s day one to remember. Don&#8217;t hesitate to give him a call, and get out on the water with him. You won&#8217;t regret it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Aaron Martin</strong></em><br><em><strong>Fisheries Biologist, <a  href=\"/trinity-river/\"><a  href=\"/category/locations/trinity-river/\"><a  href=\"/tag/trinity-river/\"><a  href=\"/fishing-news/trinity-river/\">Trinity River</a></a></a></a></strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>“Fish On! I have been fishing with Alex for over 15 years. I am currently employed as a Natural Resource Law Enforcement Officer and I have no issues recommending him or his <a  href=\"/services/\">services</a>. He is my go-to guide for salt and fresh water fishing in Northern California. Alex has guided multiple successful fishing excursions that have relied heavily on his expertise and knowledge of the area and its indigenous species. Alex has a friendly and patient coaching style that he has perfected from years of instructing students, young and old, in martial arts. Alex’s passion for the sport, contagious positive attitude and sense of humor provide the foundation for a truly memorable and enjoyable fishing outing.”</p>","template":{"templateName":"Default"}}},
